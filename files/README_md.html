        <h1>The RPM Contrib Gem</h1>

<p>The <code>rpm_contrib</code> gem contains instrumentation for the New Relic RPM agent
contributed by the community of RPM users.  It requires the RPM Agent to run.</p>

<p>To use the rpm_contrib gem, install the <code>rpm_contrib</code> gem from rubygems.org.
It will also install the required version of the <code>newrelic_rpm</code> gem if it's not
already installed.</p>

<p>For Rails 3.0 and later, add this dependency to your Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'rpm_contrib'
</code></pre>

<p>For Rails 2.1 and later, add this dependency to your in your environment.rb:</p>

<pre><code>config.gem 'rpm_contrib'
</code></pre>

<p>For other frameworks, make sure you load rubygems if it isn't already, then just
require the rpm_contrib gem:</p>

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'rpm_contrib'
</code></pre>

<p>When you load the rpm_contrib gem, the <code>newrelic_rpm</code> gem will also be
initialized.  No need for a separate require statement for <code>newrelic_rpm</code>.  The
<code>rpm_contrib</code> gem must be loaded before the <code>newrelic_rpm</code> gem initializes.</p>

<h1>Supported Frameworks</h1>

<p>A number of frameworks are supported in the contrib gem.  They are all turned on
by default but you can add settings to your newrelic.yml to disable any of them.</p>

<h3>Camping</h3>

<p>The gem will detect a Camping app but you need to manually add the
instrumentation to your configuration file.  See RPMContrib::Instrumentation::Camping
for more information.</p>

<h3>Paperclip</h3>

<p>No special configuration required for Paperclip visibility.  You can disable
it by setting <code>disable_paperclip</code> to true in the newrelic.yml file.</p>

<h3>MongoDB</h3>

<p>Both MongoMapper and Mongoid are supported.  You can disable them both by setting
'disable_mongodb' to true in the newrelic.yml file.</p>

<h3>Resque</h3>

<p>To disable resque, set 'disable_resque' to true in your newrelic.yml file.</p>

<h3>Redis</h3>

<p>Redis instrumentation will record operations as well as <code>allWeb</code> and <code>allOther</code>
summary metrics under the <code>Database/Redis</code> metric namespace. This instrumentation
supports Redis versions 1.x and 2.x. To disable Redis instrumentation, set
'disable_redis' to true in your newrelic.yml file.</p>

<h3>AWS/S3</h3>

<p>Get metrics on how S3 is performing for you in production. To disable AWS/S3, set
'disable_aws-s3' to true in your newrelic.yml file.  For more information on this
instrumentation, check out <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/2010/07/06/monitoring-aws-s3/">our blog</a>.</p>

<h1>How to Add Custom Instrumentation</h1>

<p>We encourage contributions to this project and will provide whatever assistance
we can to those wishing to develop instrumentation for other open source Ruby
libraries.</p>

<p>When adding instrumentation to this gem, be sure and get familiar with the <a href="http://newrelic.github.com/rpm/classes/NewRelic/Agent.html">RPM
Agent API</a> and
contact support@newrelic.com with any questions.</p>

<p>There are several extension points in the agent you can take advantage of with
this gem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom tracers which measure methods and give visibility to
otherwise unmeasured libraries.</li>
<li>Samplers which sample some value about once a minute.</li>
<li>Dispatcher support for web request handlers which would otherwise be undetected.
In order for the agent to turn on in 'auto' mode it needs to discover a
web dispatcher, or be <a href="http://support.newrelic.com/faqs/general/manual-start">started manually</a>.</li>
<li>Framework support, for alternatives to Rails like Camping or Ramaze</li>
</ul>


<h2>Custom Tracers</h2>

<p>Custom tracers for frameworks should be added to the <code>lib/rpm_contrib/instrumentation</code>
directory.  These files are loaded at the time the Agent starts.  <strong>They will not
be loaded if the Agent does not start up.</strong></p>

<p>It is important that you wrap any instrumentation with the checks necessary to
determine if the code being instrumented is loaded.  You can't add code to the
contrib gem that will break when run in any other context besides yours.</p>

<p>For details on how to define custom tracers, refer to the <a href="http://support.newrelic.com/faqs/docs/custom-metric-collection">support documentation
on adding custom
tracers</a>.  You
can also get detailed information on the API from the <a href="http://newrelic.github.com/rpm/classes/NewRelic/Agent/MethodTracer.html">Agent method tracing
rdocs</a>,
especially the
<a href="http://newrelic.github.com/rpm/classes/NewRelic/Agent/MethodTracer/ClassMethods.html">add_method_tracer</a>
docs.</p>

<p>A good example can be found in <code>lib/rpm_contrib/instrumentation/paperclip.rb</code>.</p>

<h2>Samplers</h2>

<p>You can add samplers which will record metrics approximately once a minute.
Samplers are useful for capturing generic instrumentation for display in <a href="http://support.newrelic.com/faqs/docs/custom-dashboard-specification">custom
views</a>.</p>

<p>Samplers should extend the
<a href="http://newrelic.github.com/rpm/classes/NewRelic/Agent/Sampler.html"><code>NewRelic::Agent::Sampler</code></a>
class.  They should be placed in the <code>samplers</code> directory.</p>

<p>Refer to examples in the RPM agent to see how to get started.</p>

<h2>Supporting New Dispatchers</h2>

<p>If you want to add support for a new dispatcher which is not being recognized by
default by the RPM agent, add code to the <code>rpm_contrib/detection</code> directory.
This code needs to define a module in the <code>NewRelic::LocalEnvironment</code> class.
This module will be accessed at the time environment detection takes place, when
the agent is initialized.</p>

<p>This module should define the method <code>discover_dispatcher</code> and return the name
of the dispatcher if detected, or defer to super.  See
<code>rpm_contrib/detection/camping.rb</code> for a good example.</p>

<h2>Supporting New Frameworks</h2>

<p>Supporting new frameworks can be pretty involved and generally involves both
adding custom instrumentation as well as framework and dispatcher detection.</p>

<p>In addition it will be necessary to define a new control class with the same
name as the framework.  This control class must go in <code>new_relic/control</code>.</p>

<p>Refer to the camping example in this gem to see how this is done in general.</p>

<p>If you decide to tackle any new frameworks, contact support@newrelic.com and
we'll be happy to help you work through it.</p>

<h1>Note on Patches/Pull Requests</h1>

<ul>
<li>Fork the http://www.github.com/newrelic/rpm_contrib project.</li>
<li>Add instrumentation files to <code>lib/rpm_contrib/instrumentation</code>.  These
files will be loaded when the RPM agent is initialized.</li>
<li>Add samplers to <code>lib/rpm_contrib/samplers</code>.  These classes are
installed automatically when the RPM agent is initialized.</li>
<li>Add tests.</li>
<li>Commit, do not mess with the Rakefile, version, or history.  (if you
want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a
commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)</li>
<li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.</li>
</ul>
